            <h2>Discovery</h2>
            <p>By interviewing the sustainability teams of various organizations, we identified the need for a tool that would allow organizations to easily gather data related to employee scope 3 emissions and suggest areas for improvement that the user could track over time. Once we had the different user personas and requirements gathered we were able to determine the platform necessary for achieving our goals:</p>
            <p>1. Admin tool - A web application designed for generating, managing and reviewing survey applications for admin users (used primarily on desktop browsers by sustainability teams)
            <p>2. Survey tool - A web survey designed for employees of all departments and positions (used on both mobile and desktop browsers)</p>
            <h2>Approach</h2>
            <p>The next step was to review existing admin tools and surveys to gain an understanding of market trends and best practices. I then fleshed out the user flow based on the different types of users:</p>
            <p>1. Giki Admins (Users who have access to all organizations)</p>
            <p>2. Org Admins (Users who have access to only their organization)</p>
            <p>3. Employees (Users who will only use the survey and not the admin site)</p>
            <img src="images/userflow3.png" class="casestudyimage"/>
            <p>After determining the high and low priority areas of functionality for the MVP, we were able to test various wireframe solutions and mock up a UI prototype in order to test the different use cases. Once we were happy with them, we developed the MVP and carried out a soft launch with smaller companies in order to develop case studies.</p>
            <h2>Results</h2>
            <p>Giki ES3 has proved to be an early success, allowing us to sign a contract with a business with over 50,000 employees even before we had completed the development phase. It has also proved benefitial in helping to renew contracts with users of other Giki products.</p>

            <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
              <div class="accordion_head">How did your approach differ from working on an existing product?<span class="plusminus">+</span></div>
              <div class="accordion_body" style="display: none;">
                <p>One of the biggest differences between the ES3 project and an existing product was the lack of existing data we had to work with. Usually the data tells a story of how a product is used and paves the way for what direction to go in but with a new product you rely more heavily on the research and discovery phase to flesh out your product functionality.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="accordion_head">What did you learn from this project?<span class="plusminus">+</span></div>
              <div class="accordion_body" style="display: none;">
                <p>Discovering that solving this problem would require designing and developing more than 1 platform to address all of the requirements was an important lesson. It showed me that two products focused on solving different problems can be better than one product that does everything.</p>
