<h2>Problem Statement</h2> 

As an organisation, I want users added into teams because they aren't joining when prompted

<h2>Description</h2>

Giki Zero is an engagement platform that allows staff to calculate their carbon footprint and take sustainable steps to lower their footprint. Often, challenges are run where teams can compete to see who can take the most steps. 

Previously, the only way to join a team was through the Join Teams page which users would often ignore. To resolve this, compulsory teams were introduced that would force a user onto the Join Teams page where a user would need to select their team before they could access any other Pro functionality on the platform. The problem here was that users would often join the wrong team or none at all and would stop engageing with the plaform altogether. 

I was tasked to resolve this issue and to find a way that will get users into the correct team without interfering with the users engagement.
