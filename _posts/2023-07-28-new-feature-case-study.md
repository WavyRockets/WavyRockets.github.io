<h2>Summary</h2>

Giki Zero is an engagement platform that allows staff to calculate their carbon footprint and take sustainable steps to lower it. Often, challenges are run where teams can compete to see who can take the most steps.

Previously, the only way to join a team was through the Join Teams page which users would often ignore, or by automating this process via subscribing to Single-Sign-On which some organisations were unable or unwilling to do. To try and resolve this, Giki introduced a ‘compulsory teams’ setting that would force a user onto the Join Teams page where a user would then need to select their team before they could access any other Pro functionality on the platform. The problem here was that users would often join the wrong team or none at all and then stop engaging with the platform altogether. They had also tested various ideas such as introducing this during the onboarding process or as a pop up which all failed to solve the problem.

I was tasked to resolve this issue and to find a way that would get users into the correct team without interfering with the users engagement.

<h2>Problem Statement</h2> 

As an organisation, I want users sorted into their correct teams because they currently aren’t joining when prompted.


<h2>Approach</h2>

My first task was to break down the problem statement into the different issues that would need to be solved as part of this project. This required defining the type of users that were likely to be impacted by this problem:

* How can we ensure new users join the correct team when signing up?
* How can we ensure existing users are sorted into the correct team after already signing up?
* How can we ensure the engagement of all users isn’t impacted by the changes made?

My next task was to carry out market research on platforms that have similar functionality. This...
