            <p>As a Giki Zero user I want the onboarding journey to be less overwhelming and easier to complete. This is because the onboarding process is too long and often leads to users dropping off before successfully onboarding.</p>

            <h2>Discovery</h2>
            <p>By speaking to several users of various demographics and watching them onboard to the platform, I identified that the largest problem was the user's frustration at the length of the onboarding process. I followed this up by analysing the onboarding related data where I could see at which point the average user was dropping off before completing the onboarding process.</p>
            <p class="standOut">The onboarding process consisted of 16 screens, 28 clicks and took an average of 3 minutes to complete.</p>
            <p>This was made up of information about the user, their goals, first steps and lifestyle information related to the user's carbon footprint such as flying, driving, and diet etc.</p>
            <h2>Approach</h2>
            <p>After brainstorming a number of solutions with the product team, we analysed the risk and reward of each and agreed upon those that had the highest reward and only selected those with a small to medium sized risk.</p>
            <p>The change with the highest risk was removing the initial footprint section from the onboarding process entirely which required updated and testing the user flow diagram. Certain organizations wanted users to learn their footprint early on while others simply wanted users signed up and using the product faster. To lower this risk, we added a setting in which this could be enabled and disabed per organization.</p>
            <img src="images/userflow.png" class="casestudyimage"/>
            <p>When footprints were enabled, we grouped the different questions to reduce the number of screens and auto selected certain options to reduce the number of clicks. For example, "Do you drive?", "Driving frequency" and "Type of car" were grouped into one screen with the initial question of 'Do you drive?" being set to Yes by default because the data suggested the majority of users do drive.</p>
            <p>An example of one of the lower risk changes that made a big difference were the changes made to the user interface. Previously, a lot of important content appeared below the fold of the screen and required scrolling. By moving all the most important content and functionality above the fold on desktop, tablet and mobile devices, we reduced the amount of scrolling, sped up the onboarding process and made it easier for users to find what they were looking for.</p>
            <h2>Results</h2>
            <p class="standOut">The onboarding process was reduced to 6 screens and 11 clicks after the removal of footprints.</p>
            <p>After being well received in user testing, the changes were released with minimal updates and data was monitored closely to follow up on the results. Immediately, we started to receive positive feedback from users both in person and through our website. The number of users failing to complete the onboarding journey dropped by 40% and client satisfaction was noted to have improved.</p>

            <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
              <div class="accordion_head">What was the biggest challenge you encountered?<span class="plusminus">+</span></div>
              <div class="accordion_body" style="display: none;">
                <p>The biggest challenge was working out the techincal restrictions with removing the footprint section during onboarding as this would go on to to impact other aspects of the product later on. To get round this challenge, brainstorming alongside the development team highlighted all the technical roadblocks I was required to avoid or resolve.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="accordion_head">What parts of the design process were not a success?<span class="plusminus">+</span></div>
              <div class="accordion_body" style="display: none;">
                <p>We had originally tested the idea of keeping the "first steps" screen within the onboarding process but when users skipped the footprint section this resulted in recommended steps being inappropriate to their lifestyle. We ultimately decided to remove this screen and prompt users to update their footprint if they wanted more personalised steps after sucessfully onboarding.</p>

              <div class="accordion_head">What approach did you take with accessibility? <span class="plusminus">+</span></div>
              <div class="accordion_body" style="display: none;">
                <p>Giki adhere to an AA level of accessiblity which is met through a series of design, content and development related changes. For example, all language and functionality is kept consistent with buttons and button labeling being large and easy to click and understand. Giki also only use colours that meet AA standards so they are easy to see and read.</p>
